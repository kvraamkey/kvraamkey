# Ramki A
Hi, I'm Ramki (he/him)—a senior FullStack Developer at @Edxi on [Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) to support open source sustainability. Previously worked on the Community & Safety team to help communities grow welcoming and productive spaces.
## My values
- Safety and trust<br>
- Expression as authentic self<br>
- Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
- Shared norms<br>
- Elevate the underrepresented

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
